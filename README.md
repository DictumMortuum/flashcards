# flashcards

[Flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) are cards that bear information, usually on both sides. One side writes a question and the other side has the answer to that question.

Flashcards are used widely as a learning tool to aid memorization. An example of a widely used method that uses flashcards is the [Leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system), a simple implementation of the principle of spaced repetition.

To use the italian flashcards, visit [this](https://dictummortuum.github.io/flashcards) site. By clicking the question box once, you will get the answer to the question. If you click the box again, another random question will be shown.

You can use the menu on the left (click the button on the top left to open the drawer) to customize the questions. Currently there are three different categories:

- irregular verbs.
- Nouns that have irregular female forms.
- Nouns that have irrregular plural forms.

You can check any combinations of these categories; only questions from the checked categories will be shown.

If you have any suggestions or you have found an error in a question, please contact me.
